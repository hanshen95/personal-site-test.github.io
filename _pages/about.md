My name is Han Shen. I am currently a Ph.D. student advised by Porf. [Tianyi Chen](https://chentianyi1991.github.io/) at [RPI](https://www.rpi.edu/). Before I start the Ph.D. program, my knowledge foundation is built around general deep learning and optimization. I was fortunate to join Prof. Tianyi Chen's group as the first Ph.D. student and grow with the research group till today. My research generally focuses on bilevel learning, nonconvex optimization and reinforcement learning.

I'm actively looking for industrial research internships. Email me for an updated CV.


## Research


My research spans the areas of optimization and machine learning, covering the following topics:

* <b> Bilevel optimization </b> Bilevel learning is a general learning framework covering a wide range of topics--adversarial learning, hyper-parameter optimization, meta learning, etc. Our research focuses on the the theory foundation and algorithm design for bilevel training. We aim to advance and improve over the current single-level training paradigm with bilevel training framework.

* <b> Reinforcement learning </b> Solving reinforcement learning problems with both online or offline policy optimization algorithms, along with recent focus on AI alginment with reinforcement learning from human feedback.

Designing efficient and principled algorithms have been my pursuit throughout my research years. At the present stage, I am exploring enhancing language model alignment with bilevel training framework.
